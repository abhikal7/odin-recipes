    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prep the chicken: Start by gently bashing the thicker end of the chicken
        so that the thickness all over is 8-10mm (⅓ inch). If you’re starting
        with large chicken breasts, you’ll need to cutlet them first, which
        simply means cutting them through the thickness to make two thinner
        breasts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marinade: Now make the marinade. Mix together buttermilk, sriracha, salt
        and garlic powder in a bowl large enough to hold the chicken breasts and
        marinade. Place the chicken into the marinade and mix well to coat all
        over. Cover and chill for 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil: In a large saucepan or dutch oven, heat 2 litres (2
        quarts) of vegetable oil to 180C / 350F. As soon as you pour the oil in,
        attach a frying thermometer to the side of the pan. It’s very important
        to keep an eye on the temperature as they cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the chicken: Gently lower the chicken into the oil and cook for 3
        minutes before turning. Cook for another minute to 90 seconds and
        they’re done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain: Transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack over a baking tray
        lined with paper towel. If you line the baking tray with plastic wrap
        first, then the paper towel, you won’t have to clean up the tray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble: Get your buns, burger and ingredients ready to assemble and
        enjoy your crispy chicken burger!
