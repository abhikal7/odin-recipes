    <h2 class="heading">Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>400g/14oz beef mince</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
      <li>100g/3.5oz carrot, grated</li>
      <li>2 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
      <li>400ml/14fl oz stock</li>
      <li>400g/14oz dried spaghetti</li>
      <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading">Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil
        and once hot add the beef mince and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the
        mince until well browned over a medium-high heat (be careful not to burn
        the mince. It just needs to be a dark brown colour). Once browned,
        transfer the mince to a bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add another tablespoon of oil to the saucepan you browned the mince in
        and turn the heat to medium. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and fry
        gently for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Add the
        garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the grated carrot then pour
        the mince and any juices in the bowl back into the saucepan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well to mix. Pour in the stock,
        bring to a simmer and then reduce the temperature to simmer gently for
        45 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and rich. Taste and adjust the
        seasoning as necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to cook the spaghetti, heat a large saucepan of water and add
        a pinch of salt. Cook according to the packet instructions. Once the
        spaghetti is cooked through, drain and add to the pan with the bolognese
        sauce. Mix well and serve.
