    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cooking oil</li>
      <li>1 and a 1/2 cups chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup plain yoghurt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken
        in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides.
        Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil
        remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft, 5 to 8
        minutes. Add curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, and 1 tablespoon
        of water into the onion mixture and stir; allow to heat together for
        about 1 minute while stirring. Add tomatoes, yogurt, and 1 teaspoon salt
        to the mixture; stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate.
        Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat
        with the sauce. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon garam masala over the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in
        the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
